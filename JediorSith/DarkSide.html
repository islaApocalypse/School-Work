            <p class="dark">The dark side of the Force, also known as Bogan, one of two ways of chanelling the Force. To tap into the power of the dark side was to indulge in raw emotions such as passion. The dark side was greed; the fear of change and the inability to let go. The Sith were Force-sensitives well known for embracing the dark side and being the mortal enemies of the Jedi.</p>

            <p class="dark">Relying on anger, fear, hatred and bitterness, which was the dark side of the Force, granted certain abilities that wielders of the light side had no access to, such as possession and the ability to manipulate Force visions. he method to use the dark side was to one let anger and hatred for someone wash them away entirely, to be filled with anger and hate and the desire to cause pain and suffering. Most dark side powers were purely offensive in nature like Force lightning. Dark side power could also be used to alter life and could, according to legend, be used to manipulate midi-chlorians to create life or keep someone from dying. The Dark side was considered "unnatural"</p>
