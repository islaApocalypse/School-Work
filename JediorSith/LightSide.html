            <h1 class="light">Light Side</h1>
            <p class="light">The light side of the Force, also commonly known as the Ashla by ancient Force-sensitives on Tython, or simply the Force by the Jedi, was a method of using the Force that entailed the devotion of oneself to the will of the Force and was aligned with honesty, compassion, mercy, and self-sacrifice. The largest group of proponents and teachers of the light side were the Jedi Order, who strove to maintain peace and justice throughout the galaxy.</p>

            <p class="light">The light side of the Force was generally harder to use than the dark side, because dark side Force powers were all aggressive and easily fueled by anger or hatred. This allowed darksiders to advance faster, but they were not inherently more powerful than the lightsiders. Light-sided Force abilities were virtually all defensive and passive in nature. While there were light-side abilities for increasing one's strength or courage, or incapacitating an enemy, none of them were truly aggressive (with the notable exceptions of Electric Judgment, Sever Force, and Combustion).</p>
