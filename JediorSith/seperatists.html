            <h1 class="cis">Confederacy of Independent Systems</h1>
            <p class="cis">The Confederacy of Independent Systems (24 BBY–19 BBY), abbreviated to CIS, and also known as the Separatist Alliance or the Separatist State, was an unrecognized breakaway state that fought against the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. Formed by thousands of star systems from the Mid Rim to the Outer Rim that broke away from the Republic, the Confederacy was founded on the grounds of excessive taxation and corruption within the Galactic Senate and general feeling of dissatisfaction towards and neglect by the Core Worlds, which contained some of the wealthiest and most prestigious planets in the galaxy. The Separatist Crisis that began in 24 BBY led to a political crisis in which tensions escalated between the newly-formed Confederacy and the reigning Republic. In 22 BBY, the Confederacy and the Republic went to war using their respective military forces—the droid army and the Republic clone army—resulting in a pan-galactic conflict for the first time in a millennium. The following three years saw the Clone Wars raging across the galaxy with the Separatists rapidly attempting to bring the Republic to its knees.</p>
