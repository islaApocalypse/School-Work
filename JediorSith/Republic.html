            <h1 class="republic">Galactic Republic</h1>
            <p class="republic">The Galactic Republic, often referred to as simply the Republic, is an interstellar state, where it existed prior to the establishment of the Galactic Empire. Also referred to as the Old Republic, and was around up until the end of the Clone Wars. Old Republic was a term affixed to the pre-modern Republic that existed until 1032 BBY, and the modern Republic that was supplanted by the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY. In addition, the term High Republic denoted the era in which the Republic reached the zenith of its power from 300 BBY to 82 BBY. The Republic was founded many millennia before the Battle of Yavin, approximately 25,000 BBY, around the same time as the Jedi Order. The Galactic Senate governed the Republic under the Galactic Constitution, and comprised thousands of senators representing the Republic's member worlds. The Supreme Chancellor was the title of the Republic head of state, elected from ranks of the Senate to lead the government on Coruscant. The Republic governed the galaxy from the Core Worlds to the Outer Rim Territories, uniting various sentient species, human and alien alike, under one banner.</p>

            <p class="republic">The Galactic Republic placed its faith in the Jedi Order, relying on Jedi Knights to safeguard peace and justice in the realm. The Judicial Forces were the armed peacekeeping forces of the Galactic Republic Judicial Department. While the Jedi helped to maintain order and peace under the authority of the Galactic Senate, they were not considered a standing military. As officers of the government, Judicials had access to Consular-class space cruisers. The Republic Defense Coalition, also known as the RDC, was organized as a small peacekeeping fleet that defended the Galactic Republic's interests during the High Republic Era. The RDC was bound together as an organization through defense treaties signed by the Republic's member worlds, including Alderaan and Chandrila.</p>
